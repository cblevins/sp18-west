## One Last Lecture...


A few of you are history majors, but I know for the majority of you, this is probably the last history class you’ll ever take. 

[remember me]
- Which is a lot of pressure for me. 
- This is it!
	- the **last shot** I’ve got for you to remember me.

[remember me crossed]
- Now I should clarify that I don’t actually care if you remember **ME**, specifically,
	- me as a person or even me as a professor. 
- Feel free to immediately forget every detail about me. 
- But what worries me is that this class becomes one of those classes you immediately forget
	- a class that just kind of **runs together** with the dozens of other classes you took at Northeastern.

- So on that note, I want you to take that index card and write down **one thing** you’re going to remember from this class. 
- Five years from now, what are you going to remember? This can be anything you want:
	- a big theme or topic
	- an assignment or activity
	- A lecture or a story 
	- A factoid, person, event, whatever you want
- I'm doing this partly because I'm curious what you find most memorable.
- But I'm also doing this because I want you to, in fact, remember this class.
- That could be the content of the course, and I’m certainly hoping you learned new things about the western United States.
- But in another sense, I don't actually care that much about the nitty-gritty details of the content, either.
    - I don’t care whether five years from now you remember the Battle of Glorietta Pass
    - Or, to use an example of something I messed up earlier this semester - whether it was James Marshall or John Marshall who discovered gold at Sutter’s Creek

- I'm guessing none of you are going to become a historian. 
- But whatever career or life path you end up choosing, I hope that you remember some of the **core principles of historical thinking** that we’ve talked about over the past couple of months
- I hope you come away from this class with **a curiosity about the past**
- The relationship between **geography and history**
- A thoughtfulness about **myth, memory, and history**
- And above all, an appreciation for **how the past continues shapes the present**

- So why do I think you should you remember this class? 
- The answer has very little to do with what happened a hundred years ago in the West
- And everything to do with the present world we live in today
- To try and drive home what I mean by that, I’m going to look at an event from the present-day
    - this particular event happened five days ago
    - right across the Charles River, just a few miles away
- I want to look at this event to show you why history is so important

[Police]

- Last Friday night, several Cambridge Police officers responded to multiple calls 
    - that a naked man was wandering down the middle of Mass Ave
    - he was acting erratically, and had thrown his clothes at a woman
- After confronting the man and talking to him for several minutes, 
    - eventually the man in question approached one of the officers
    - Which led a second officer to tackle him to the ground, 
    - He struggled, they try to restrain him, and 
    - During this struggle one of the officers punched the man four or five times in the stomach
- They subsequently arrested him and charged him with "indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, assault, resisting arrest, and assault and battery on ambulance personnel”
- It turned out this man, Selorm Ohene 
    - is a black mathematics major at Harvard, 
    - and news outlets across the country have picked up the story
- So how does studying history help us understand what happened last Friday night?

[interpretation]

- I know you’re sick and tired of seeing this slide by now,
- But I show it so many times for a reason
- History is an act of interpretation
- I mean this on two different levels

[report]

- First, on a basic level, we need to interpret **what actually happened that night**
- If we treat this as a historical event, we need to get the details of what happened
    - the who, what, when, and where
- Which, as you've hopefully learned in this class,
    - Is **never as easy as it might seem**
- It requires you to look at as many different sources as you can

- For this particular event, 
    - we might read the **police report** filed by one of the officers
    - It says how they interviewed two of the student’s companions, who said that Ohene might have ingested hallucinogens, which could explain his erratic behavior
    - And goes on to say:
    - "As Ohene [the name of the student] and I conversed, I observed him clinch both his fists. Ohene started to take steps towards officers in a an aggressive manner. I perceived this as a threat and thought an attack was imminent."
    - It goes on to say, "We gave Ohene verbal commands to give us his hands which he did not. Unable to pry Ohene's hands from underneath his body, I delivered approximately 5 strikes with a closed fists to the area of his stomach.” 

[video]

- But as we've learned, we can’t rely on just one source
    - Especially one that is narrating an event from a single perspective
    - Fortunately for future historians studying 2018
    - Cell phones are everywhere
    - Which meant that onlookers actually took several videos of the event
    - In this case, we’d want to look at these videos to try and piece together the details of what happened
- This is really no different from the kind of analysis you’ve done in this class
- A cell phone video or a police report - these are **primary sources**
    - Think about the maps of New Spain that you looked at, that had no idea what was in the interior of the West
    - Or anti-immigrant political cartoons
    - Or, perhaps most relevant, first-hand accounts of the events at Sand Creek
- Historical thinking forces you to look at these kinds of sources critically
    - to try and take into account not only **what it says**, 
    - but also who made it
    - under what conditions
    - from what perspective 
    - and for what audience
    - What are these sources missing?
    - What are their limits?
- Again, these are crucial skills not just for understanding something that happened a hundred years ago, but for understanding something that happened **RIGHT NOW**, a few miles away, in 2018.

[interpretation]

- The second kind of historical interpretation involves getting beyond this basic level of what happened
- Because understanding the past is not just collecting **facts, dates, and names**
- You have to piece them together into a larger narrative or interpretation in order to understand **the significance** of these kinds of events, why they matter and how they fit together.

[commissioner vs. president]

- In the last couple of days, **two competing narratives or interpretations** have emerged about last Friday’s arrest
- On Sunday, the president of Harvard, again, the school where this man was a student
    - Called the incident **“profoundly disturbing”**
    - Activists have taken it up as an example of police brutality and the kind of racism that infects our criminal justice system
- On the other side of the ledger, 
    - the Cambridge police commissioner held a press conference on Monday
    - where he expressed his full-throated support for the officers in question
    - saying they were simply taking actions to protect bystanders, themselves, and the man himself
- Again, **two conflicting interpretations** not necessarily of the details of what happened, 
	- but of the meaning and significance behind it
- If we think of this event as historians, we need to **evaluate** both of these interpretations

[empathy]

- To do that, you have to use that other skill that I keep yammering on about: **historical empathy**
	- the ability to put yourself in the shoes of the people who lived in the past and see the world through their eyes
- I would argue that that if you can pull off **historical** empathy
    - of understanding how the world looked through the eyes of a person who lived a hundred years ago
    - a world that is was so incredibly, radically different from our own
- If you can do **THAT**, then you’ll be better equipped to put yourself in the shoes of someone living today

[commissioner]

- Let’s go back to the interpretation put forward by the Cambridge police commissioner
- Empathy forces us to take his interpretation of the events seriously.
- So let's think about it from the perspective of one of his officers who was there
    - There’s a naked man wandering in the middle of a busy street
    - He’s incoherent and behaving erratically, 
    - He’s thrown his clothes at someone
    - And you’ve received six different 911 calls
- So on a basic level, you can understand why they might have approached the situation with a certain degree of caution and suspicion

[context]

- More broadly, though, that skill of empathy involves understanding the **CONTEXT** of an event
- In the case of last Friday’s arrest, there might have been **other reasons** why the officers decided so quickly to resort to force

[slain officer]

- In fact, just one day before the event a police officer in Yarmouth, Massachusetts, was killed while serving an arrest warrant
- I can't know for sure, but these Cambridge police officers were probably aware of this
- Because the wider law enforcement community across Massachusetts had been offering their condolences to the officer’s family for the past 24 hours
- Perhaps they had this event on their minds, 
    - perhaps they were thinking about **their own** families
    - maybe all of this put them on edge when they arrived at the scene last Friday night
- This is what I mean by context

[empathy]

- But historical empathy does not mean that all narratives and all interpretations are somehow equally valid
- It’s not just trying too see both sides and leaving it there
- At some point, you've got to choose an interpretation based on the information, the context, and your own analysis

[Harvard]

- In this case, my own interpretation falls a lot closer to the other side of the ledger
- The one that sees this event as **"profoundly disturbing"**
- The reason for this is that this event is not taking place in a vacuum

[Black Lives Matter]

- When police officers use violence against a black man
- It is deeply entangled within a national conversation that has emerged over the past few years
- The Black Lives Matter movement
- That has called attention to a recurrent pattern of police violence against people of color

[Michael Brown]

- It’s a conversation that was sparked by the killing of Michael Brown at the hands of a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014
- Followed in short order 

[Eric Garner]

- By the killing of Eric Garner
- in New York City

[Tamir Rice]

- And Tamir Rice in Ohio

[rodney king]

- This isn't some **recent phenomenon**
- It's part of a much longer history
- Last Friday's events call to mind Rodney King, 
    - a black taxi driver in Los Angeles who was pulled over in 1991
    - and severely beaten by members of the LAPD
- Despite the fact that it was captured on video... 
- A jury acquitted the officers in question

- All of which ties into an even **longer pattern** in this country
- Of Americans seeing black men 
    - As violent
    - As dangerous criminals
    - or even animals

[darren wilson]

- You can see this if you start using another one of those historian's skills
	- the close reading and analysis of sources
- And apply those skills to the grand jury testimony of the white officer who killed Michael Brown 
- You can see how he described the eighteen-year-old in precisely these kinds of animalistic, violent terms
- Testifying that:
    - “I’ve never seen anybody look that, for lack of a better word, crazy. I’ve never seen that. I mean, it was very aggravated...aggressive, hostile.”
    - He “had the most aggressive face. That’s the only way I can describe it, it looks like a demon, that’s how angry he looked.”
    - And finally, when he explained why he shot Michael Brown no fewer than **twelve times**
    - he explained it was because the teenager seemed unstoppable, that “it looked like he was almost bulking up to run through the shots”

[cambridge police report]

- Again, applying those close reading skills to another document
- The police report from this past weekend
- You can see parallels in how the officer describes the Harvard student Selorm Ohene
	- Aggressive, hostile, intimidating
	- Calling attention to the student’s **physicality**, that he was muscular
	- And how he didn’t even seem to feel pain
- This language fits within a larger pattern in which Americans of all stripes and political persuasions see black men as **threatening** and **dangerous**
- This is partly what I mean by the need to understand a larger historical context

[History and Geography]

- But to understand events, you also have to understand the local history of individual places
- Remember that one of the themes of this class was the relationship between history and geography
- How **local context** shapes the history of particular places
- Think back to that exercise you did near the beginning of class, 
    - using crayons to draw that caricatured **View of the World** from Northeastern University
- Part of the reason why I had you do this
- Was that it forces you to think about the perspective of how the world looks from a particular place
- And if you look at the world from the perspective of Boston
    - you start to understand the importance of this local context behind last Friday’s event

[big Irish]
- Just this year, a Boston police officer shot an  African immigrant driving an ATV
- It turned out that the officer had a long history of making racist posts on online message boards under the screen name, and I swear I’m not making this up, "Big Irish"

[uber]
- Or the case of another Boston police officer who was convicted of racially motivated violence in 2015
	- when he drunkenly attacked his Uber driver
	- shouting racial insults as he did so

[gates]
- Or go back a few more years, to 2009, and to Cambridge itself, not all that far from where this student was arrested last Friday
- In 2009 a black Harvard professor named Henry Louis Gates Jr. 
    - had forgotten his keys and accidentally locked himself out of his house
    - When he tried to get back in
    - a neighbor called the police because she saw a black man robbing a house
    - A Cambridge police officer arrived at the scene, got into a confrontation with Gates, and led him off in handcuffs
    - Again, this is a nationally respected professor at the most famous university in the country
    - Arrested for breaking and entering into his own home 

[jungle]
- Of course, after this event happened, 
	- yet another police officer in Boston sent an incredibly racist email about Professor Gates
	- Before claiming that, quote, “I am not a racist”

[Bussing]
- Or we can go back even further, to the 1970s
- When white Bostonians became enraged after the city instituted bussing to bring black students to largely white schools 
    - to try and **desegregate** the city’s school system
- Leading to this famous photograph of a white Boston man attacking a black civil rights leader with an American flag, near the steps of city hall

[faulkner]
- All of this calls to mind that William Faulkner quote, "The past is never dead. It’s not even past." 
- Everything has a history 
	- And while not all of that history is equally important for understanding the present
	- Part of why we study history is to figure out which parts of it matter and how they all fit together
- In the case of the police violence last Friday against the black student in Cambridge
- I would say that all of this history that I just showed you, it *does* matter.
	- Applying historical thinking to this event is what allows us to understand it better
	- To interpret the event, not only in terms of what happened but **how it fits into a larger context**
	- To see it not as some isolated, present-day event 
	- But as part of a larger historical narrative
	- a **larger historical structure**

- If you remember nothing else from this class, I want you to remember this
- That history is not neutral
	- it’s not simply stuff that happened
	- it’s not dead
- History is a living, breathing thing
- The past exercises enormous power over the present, over our world today
- To understand this present world
	- it’s absolutely crucial that we understand that past

- And **THAT** is why I want you to remember my class.
