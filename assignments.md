**Required Readings**

There are four required texts that you must purchase for this class (the rest of the readings will be provided to you by the instructor). You can purchase these texts either in the campus bookstore or through other retailers:
- Elizabeth Fenn, *Encounters at the Heart of the World: A History of the Mandan People*
- Mine Okubo, *Citizen 13660*
- Andrés Reséndez, *The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America*
- Elliott West, *The Essential West: Collected Essays*

**Participation and Attendance (20%)**

Students are to attend each class having completed the readings or other assignments and be prepared to discuss them. One unexcused absence is allowed per semester, after which any absences will require documentation. See course policies for more information.

**Geography Quiz (5%)** - *Wednesday, January 17th* 

Locate places and geographical features on a blank map of western North America. You will be given a study guide with a list of possible identifications ahead of time.

**Midterm (15%)** - *Due Sunday February 25th*

Take-home exam consisting of short identifications and essay questions.

**Pop Culture Review (20%)** - *Due Sunday March 18th*

Write a 4-5 page (1,250-1,500 words) review of a movie, TV series, video game, novel, art exhibit, or other piece of pop culture that falls loosely under the "Western" genre. [Full description of the assignment]({{site.baseurl}}/pop-culture-review).

**Place Analysis (25%)** - *Due Monday, April 16th*

Select a particular location and analyze its history and geography within the broader context of the western U.S. How you define the location is  up to you. It can be a particular building (the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas), street (San Francisco's Mission Street), neighborhood (Compton), geological feature (the Grand Canyon), or community (Vail Ski Resort). Some questions to consider: What are some of the important events, people, or processes that unfolded at this place? What was this place's significance for the region? How does understanding this place help us understand the West?

You will be presenting your analysis in an alternative format from the traditional 1,500-2,000 word final paper: an **"unessay."** This can take any format you like: podcast episode, sculpture, restaurant menu, board game, meme collage, etc. I want you to think creatively and apply whatever skills and interests you have to the assignment. For those who find this assignment daunting, I will provide guidance for a "default" option: an online exhibit of historical sources related to your place. Regardless of the format, the key requirement is that you must present a clear analysis and interpretation of your place that is supported by both primary and secondary sources. Each analysis will include an annotated bibliography of sources consulted and, depending on the format of your analysis, a written overview introducing and explaining the project. This final project can be completed individually or in groups of up to three students. You are required to meet with me during office hours to discuss your idea, a plan for completion, and to ensure that it is both feasible and meets the goals of the assignment.

**Final Exam (15%)** - *TBD*

Exam consisting of short identifications and essay questions.
